# Data-Retrivel

This program is a Python script that helps you extract student records from two separate Excel datasets—one for math and one for science—based on roll numbers you provide. It prompts you to enter a roll number for each subject, searches for the corresponding student entries in both datasets, and if both are found, combines them and saves the results to a new Excel file called results.xlsx . If a roll number is not found in either dataset, it notifies you. This is useful for quickly gathering and merging student data from different subject files.
